# OpenSpec Agent Workflow

## Overview
The OpenSpec workflow is designed to facilitate collaboration between human developers and AI agents in the development process. This document outlines how to work effectively with AI agents on this project.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Feature Proposal
1. Define the feature scope and requirements
2. Create an OpenSpec proposal document
3. Review and refine with AI agent feedback

### 2. Design Phase
1. Work with AI to break down the feature into components
2. Design API interfaces and data structures
3. Plan visualization components
4. Document design decisions

### 3. Implementation
1. Create feature branch
2. Implement core functionality
3. Add tests with AI guidance
4. Create visualizations
5. Document changes

### 4. Review & Iteration
1. AI reviews code changes
2. Suggests improvements
3. Helps optimize performance
4. Ensures documentation completeness

## Working with AI Agents

### Best Practices
1. Provide clear context and requirements
2. Ask for specific feedback
3. Use OpenSpec proposals for new features
4. Keep documentation up-to-date

### Communication Guidelines
1. Be specific about requirements
2. Share relevant code context
3. Ask for clarification when needed
4. Document decisions and rationale
