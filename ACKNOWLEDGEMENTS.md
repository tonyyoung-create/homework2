This project was developed by extending and integrating ideas from the book "Hands-On Artificial Intelligence for Cybersecurity" (Packt) and the associated example code repository.

Reference:
- Packt repository: https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Artificial-Intelligence-for-Cybersecurity

Project contributions and modifications in this repository include:
- Robust preprocessing with NLTK fallback behavior (so CI/tests can run offline)
- Additional visualization fallbacks (wordcloud â†¦ bar chart) to prevent runtime crashes
- Streamlit app improvements (batch predictions, performance page, safe probability display)
